  <h1>Nexocoin</h1>
  <p>
    Nexocoin (NXC) is a sovereign, independent cryptocurrency operating on its own
    native blockchain. It is not a token issued on another network and does not
    depend on external platforms for consensus, validation, or settlement.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Nexocoin network is designed as a base-layer digital currency system,
    implementing all core components directly at the protocol level, including
    consensus, monetary issuance, transaction validation, and network security.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nexocoin prioritizes security, decentralization, and long-term economic
    sustainability. The protocol is engineered to provide predictable transaction
    costs, deterministic behavior, and transparent on-chain rules suitable for
    real-world usage.
  </p>

  <p>
    By operating as a fully independent blockchain, Nexocoin avoids inherited risks
    from external platforms and defines its own security assumptions, performance
    characteristics, and economic parameters.
